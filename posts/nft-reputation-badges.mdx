## The Trust Challenge in Digital Marketplaces

Traditional artisan marketplaces face a significant challenge: establishing trust between clients and service providers. While review systems exist, they're often centralized, easy to manipulate, and don't truly capture an artisan's expertise and reliability.

## Introducing NFT Reputation Badges

Wurana's NFT Reputation Badges represent a paradigm shift in how we verify and showcase artisan credentials. These non-fungible tokens are:

- **Immutable**: Cannot be altered or fabricated
- **Verifiable**: Easy to validate on the Solana blockchain
- **Portable**: Can be displayed across different platforms
- **Valuable**: Represent real achievements and expertise

## How It Works

1. **Complete Projects**: Successfully deliver quality work to clients
2. **Earn Reviews**: Receive verified feedback from customers
3. **Mint Badges**: Automatically receive NFT badges based on performance
4. **Build Portfolio**: Create a verifiable track record of excellence
